# VidUrh.github.io

This website and all its subsites were created entirely in HTML5, CSS3 and javascript, without any framework.
The website was created for my school project and the subsites were made when I started learning web development. 

> NOTE: This website is really old (I think from 2018 and the content was never updated so the information on the website is likely to be very out-of-date.
